# Spotify Song Suggester

## Backend docs located at **templink.gov**

### Build an app to enable users to browse and visualize audio features of over 116k Spotify songs

## MVP

1. User registration/login flow
2. User can save their favorite songs to their profile in the Web backend
3. Once the user has their favorites saved the DS API can make suggestions based on the audio features of their favorites.
4. User can request suggested songs based on what they are in the mood for ( acousticness, danceability, duration, energy, etc)
5. User can edit and delete their favorites.
